## Hidden features (h_heatures)
In a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), the number of hidden features (h_features) refers to the size of the hidden layer in the GCN model. The hidden layer is an intermediate layer between the input and the output in the GCN model that processes the graph structure and node features to produce the final node representations.

The value of h_features can be adjusted to control the capacity of the GCN model. Increasing the number of hidden features will allow the model to learn more complex representations, while decreasing it will result in a simpler and faster model.
