"""
Module: src

This module contains the core components of the project, organized into submodules and directories.
These components include various agent algorithms, the API for board evaluation, configuration files,
the evaluation engine, the environment setup, data generators, training data, translation utilities,
and general utilities.

Directory Structure:
- agent_basic_dqn: Contains the implementation of a basic Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent.
- agent_dqn: Contains the implementation of an advanced Deep Q-Network (DQN) agent with additional features.
- agent_ppo: Contains the implementation of a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent.
- agent_q: Contains the implementation of a Q-Learning agent.
- API: Contains the FastAPI web service for board evaluation and related utilities.
- configs: Contains various JSON configuration files for the project.
- engine: Contains the evaluation engine for processing and analyzing boards.
- environment: Contains the code and utilities for setting up the simulation environment.
- generator: Contains code for generating training data and various permutations of configurations.
- train_data: Contains the generated training data used for training the agents.
- translation: Contains utilities for translating data between different formats and representations.
- utils: Contains general utility functions and classes used throughout the project.
