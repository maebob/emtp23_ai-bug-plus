"""
This folder contains configurations for BugPlus with a maximum of 3 bugs.

Explanation of file names:
(x,y) is the input pair corresponding to UP and DOWN.
2x_y shows the result for "2x+y", where in the last bug, 2x and y are added together.

Note: x+y_x produces the same output "2x+y", but the connections in the first bugs are different.
This folder does not contain all possible configurations for each result but at least one.
Some results are built in various ways.
